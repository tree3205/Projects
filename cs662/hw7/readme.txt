Just run the command line: sentiment.py, then you can see the accuracies obtained for both Pros and Cons with and without negation handling. (The directory of two data file have been given, so you need to change them to the directory in your computer)

The result would like to be this:

The accuracy without negation: 
IntegratedCons.txt: pros -> 0.122, cons -> 0.878
IntegratedPros.txt: pros -> 0.748, cons -> 0.252
The accuracy with negation: 
IntegratedCons.txt: pros -> 0.120, cons -> 0.880
IntegratedPros.txt: pros -> 0.749, cons -> 0.251
