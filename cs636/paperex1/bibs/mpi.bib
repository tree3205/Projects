  abstract =   {Parallel jobs are different from sequential jobs and require a
        different type of process management. We present here a process
        management system for parallel programs such as those written
        using MPI. A primary goal of the system, which we call MPD (for
        multipurpose daemon), is to be scalable. By this we mean that
        startup of interactive parallel jobs comprising thousands
        ofprocesses is quick, that signals can be quickly delivered to
        processes, and that stdin, stdout, and stderr are managed
        intuitively. Our primary target is parallel machines made up of
        clusters of SMPs, but the system is also useful in more tightly
        integrated environments. We describe how MPD enablesfast startup
        and convenient runtime management of parallel jobs. We show how
        close control of stdio can support the easy implementation of a
        number of convenient system utilities, even a parallel debugger.
        We describe a simple but general interface that can be used to
        separate any process manager from a parallel library, which we
        use to keep MPD separate from MPICH.}
