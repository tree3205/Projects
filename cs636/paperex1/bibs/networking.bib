		 namespace for UUIDs (Universally Unique IDentifier),
		 also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique IDentifier). A
		 UUID is 128 bits long, and can guarantee uniqueness
		 across space and time. UUIDs were originally used in
		 the Apollo Network Computing System and later in the
		 Open Software Foundation's (OSF) Distributed Computing
		 Environment (DCE), and then in Microsoft Windows
		 platforms. This specification is derived from the DCE
		 specification with the kind permission of the OSF (now
		 known as The Open Group). Information from earlier

  topic =	"urn[0.7] uuid[0.8]",
  abstract =	"The implementation of protocol P on a sending host S
		 decides, through protocol P's routing mechanism, that it 
		 wants to transmit to a target host T located some place on a 
		 connected piece of 10Mbit Ethernet cable.  To actually 
		 transmit the Ethernet packet a 48.bit Ethernet address must 
		 be generated.  The addresses of hosts within protocol P are 
		 not always compatible with the corresponding Ethernet address 
		 (being different lengths or values).  Presented here is a 
		 protocol that allows dynamic distribution of the information 
		 needed to build tables to translate an address A in protocol 
		 P's address space into a 48.bit Ethernet address.",
