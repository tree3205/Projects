  abstract =	"Orca is a portable, object-based distributed shared
		 memory (DSM) system. This article studies and evaluates
		 the design choices made in the Orca system and compares
		 Orca with other DSMs. The article gives a quantitative
		 analysis of Orca's coherence protocol (based on
		 write-updates with function shipping), the totally
		 ordered group communication protocol, the strategy for
		 object placement, and the all-software, user-space
		 architecture. Performance measurements for 10 parallel
		 applications illustrate the trade-offs made in the
		 design of Orca and show that essentially the right
		 design decisions have been made. A write-update
		 protocol with function shipping is effective for Orca,
		 especially since it is used in combination with
		 techniques that avoid replicating objects that have a
		 low read/write ratio. The overhead of totally ordered
		 group communication on application performance is low.
		 The Orca system is able to make near-optimal decisions
		 for object placement and replication. In addition, the
		 article compares the performance of Orca with that of a
		 page-based DSM (TreadMarks) and another object-based
		 DSM (CRL). It also analyzes the communication overhead
		 of the DSMs for several applications. All performance
		 measurements are done on a 32-node Pentium Pro cluster
		 with Myrinet and Fast Ethernet networks. The results
		 show that Orca programs send fewer messages and less
		 data than the TreadMarks and CRL programs and obtain
		 better speedups.",
