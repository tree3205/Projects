\begin{abstract}

We present a novel state management mechanism that can be used to
capture the complete execution state of distributed Python applications.
This mechanism can serve as the foundation for a variety of
dependability strategies including checkpointing, replication, and
migration. Python is increasingly used for rapid prototyping parallel
programs and, in some cases, used for high-performance application
development using libraries such as NumPy. Building on Stackless Python
and the River parallel and distributed programming environment, we have
developed mechanisms for state capture at the language level. Our
approach allows for migration and checkpointing of applications in
heterogeneous environments. In addition, we allow for preemptive state
capture so that programmers need not introduce explicit snapshot
requests. Our mechanism can be extended to support application or
domain-specific state capture. To our knowledge, this is the first
general checkpointing scheme for Python. We describe our system, the
implementation, and give some initial performance figures.
